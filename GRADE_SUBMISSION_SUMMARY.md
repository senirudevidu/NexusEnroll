    {"enrollment_id": 1, "grade": "A"},
    {"enrollment_id": 2, "grade": "85.5"},
    {"enrollment_id": 3, "grade": "B"}
  ]
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "status": "Completed",
  "successful": 3,
  "failed": 0,
  "results": [
    { "enrollment_id": 1, "status": "Success" },
    { "enrollment_id": 2, "status": "Success" },
