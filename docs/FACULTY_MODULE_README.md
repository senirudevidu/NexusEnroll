### 3. Course Information Management ✅

**Description**: Instructors can submit requests for course changes that require admin approval.

**Features**:

- Update course descriptions
- Add prerequisites
- Change course capacity
- Admin approval workflow
- Request history tracking
- Status monitoring (Pending/Approved/Rejected)

**Database Schema**:

```sql
CourseRequest(
    request_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    facultyMem_Id INT NOT NULL,
    course_id INT NOT NULL,
    requestType VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    details TEXT,
    requestDate TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    status ENUM('Pending', 'Approved', 'Rejected') DEFAULT 'Pending',
    decisionDate TIMESTAMP NULL,
    approvedBy INT NULL
)
```

**API Endpoints**:

- `POST /api/course-requests` - Submit request
- `GET /api/course-requests/pending` - Admin view of pending requests
- `GET /api/course-requests/faculty/:faculty_id` - Faculty request history
- `PUT /api/course-requests/:request_id/approve` - Approve request
- `PUT /api/course-requests/:request_id/reject` - Reject request
- `GET /api/course-requests/:request_id` - Get request details

**Frontend Features**:

- Request submission form with dynamic fields
- Admin approval interface
- Request history with status tracking
- Real-time status updates

**Implementation Files**:

- **DAL**: `backend/dal/courseRequest.py`
- **Service**: `backend/service/courseRequestService.py`
- **Routes**: `backend/presentation/routes.py` - Lines 1039-1180
- **Frontend**: `static/js/faculty.js` - Course request functions
- **Template**: `templates/faculty_dashboard.html` - Course Requests tab

## Module Decoupling

The Faculty Module maintains strict separation between its three main components:

1. **Roster Management** - Independent roster viewing and export functionality
2. **Grade Submission** - Isolated grade management with state transitions
3. **Course Requests** - Separate workflow for course change requests

Each component:

- Has its own DAL, Service, and API endpoints
- Maintains independent state
- Uses separate database tables where applicable
- Can function independently of other components

## Validation and Error Handling

### Grade Submission Validation

- Grade format validation (A-F or 0-100)
- Enrollment status verification
- Faculty authorization checks
- State transition validation (Pending → Submitted)

### Course Request Validation

- Faculty course ownership verification
- Request type validation
- Business logic validation (e.g., capacity constraints)
- Admin authorization for approvals

### Roster Access Control

- Faculty-course relationship verification
- Active enrollment filtering
- Permission-based access control

## State Management

### Grade Submission States

- **In Progress**: Initial enrollment state
- **Pending**: Grade entered but not submitted
- **Submitted**: Final grade submitted and locked

### Course Request States

- **Pending**: Request submitted, awaiting admin review
- **Approved**: Request approved and changes applied
- **Rejected**: Request denied by admin

## Testing

The module has been tested with:

- Various user roles and permissions
- Edge cases for grade validation
- Course request approval workflows
- Error handling scenarios
- Database transaction integrity

## Usage

1. **Access Faculty Dashboard**: Login as faculty user and navigate to `/faculty`
2. **View Rosters**: Select course from dropdown in "Class Rosters" tab
3. **Submit Grades**: Use "Grade Submission" tab for grade management
4. **Request Changes**: Submit course change requests in "Course Requests" tab
5. **Monitor Status**: Track request status in request history

## Security Features

- Faculty-course authorization checks
- Role-based access control
- SQL injection prevention
- Transaction-based operations
- Input validation and sanitization

## Performance Features

- Efficient database queries with proper joins
- Lazy loading of course data
- Batch operations for grade submissions
- Optimized roster data retrieval
- CSV export with memory-efficient streaming

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Accessible interface design

## Conclusion

The Faculty Module is fully implemented with all requested features, proper architecture, comprehensive error handling, and a user-friendly interface. The module is production-ready and maintains high standards for security, performance, and maintainability.
