- `GET /api/reports/export/html?type=faculty`

## Usage Examples

### 1. Business School High Capacity Report

```python
from backend.service.reportingService import ReportingService

# Initialize service
service = ReportingService()

# Get Business school courses over 90% capacity
result = service.get_business_school_high_capacity_report(90)

if result["status"] == "Success":
    courses = result["data"]
    summary = result["summary"]

    print(f"Found {summary['totalCourses']} Business courses over 90% capacity")
    print(f"Average utilization: {summary['averageUtilization']}%")

    for course in courses:
        print(f"- {course['courseName']}: {course['utilizationPercentage']}%")
        print(f"  Instructor: {course['instructor']}")
        print(f"  Capacity: {course['enrolledStudents']}/{course['totalCapacity']}")
```

### 2. Faculty Workload Analysis

```python
# Get all faculty workload data
result = service.get_faculty_workload_report()

if result["status"] == "Success":
    faculty_data = result["data"]

    for faculty in faculty_data:
        print(f"{faculty['facultyName']} ({faculty['department']})")
        print(f"  Courses: {faculty['numberOfCourses']}")
        print(f"  Students: {faculty['totalEnrolledStudents']}")
        print(f"  Avg per course: {faculty['avgStudentsPerCourse']}")
```

### 3. Export Reports

```python
# Export as JSON
json_result = service.export_report_as_json(report_data)
with open('report.json', 'w') as f:
    f.write(json_result["data"])

# Export as HTML
html_result = service.export_report_as_html(report_data, "University Report")
with open('report.html', 'w') as f:
    f.write(html_result["data"])
```

## Dashboard Features

### Interactive Analytics

- **Real-time Data**: Auto-refreshing charts and metrics
- **Filtering**: Department, semester, and threshold-based filtering
- **Visualization**: Charts using Chart.js for trends and distributions
- **Export**: One-click export to JSON/HTML formats

### User Interface

- **Tabbed Navigation**: Organized sections for different report types
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded capacity and status badges
- **Progress Bars**: Visual utilization percentage displays

## Database Schema Requirements

The module works with existing tables:

- `Course` - Course information and capacity data
- `Department` - Department details
- `Users` - Faculty information
- `FacultyStaff` - Faculty-course relationships
- `Enrollment` - Student enrollment data

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Backend Setup

All backend components are ready to use with the existing Flask application.

### 2. Frontend Integration

Add to your base template or admin dashboard:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/reports.css') }}"
/>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
<script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='js/reports.js') }}"></script>
```

### 3. Navigation Link

Add to admin dashboard:

```html
<a href="/reports" class="btn btn-primary">ðŸ“Š Reports & Analytics</a>
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
python test_reports.py
```

This will test:

- All report generation functions
- Data export capabilities
- Error handling
- Database connectivity

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Optimization**

   - Indexed queries on commonly filtered columns
   - Efficient JOINs across related tables
   - Pagination for large datasets

2. **Caching Strategy**

   - Consider implementing Redis for frequently accessed reports
   - Cache department and faculty lists
   - Implement query result caching

3. **Export Optimization**
   - Stream large exports to prevent memory issues
   - Implement background job processing for large reports

## Security Features

1. **Access Control**

   - Role-based access (admin only for sensitive reports)
   - Session validation
   - Parameter sanitization

2. **Data Protection**
   - SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Secure file download mechanisms

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Analytics**

   - Predictive enrollment modeling
   - Capacity planning recommendations
   - Student performance correlation analysis

2. **Additional Export Formats**

   - Excel/CSV export capabilities
   - PDF report generation
   - Email report scheduling

3. **Real-time Dashboards**
   - Live enrollment tracking
   - WebSocket-based updates
   - Alert notifications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**

   - Verify database configuration in `dbconfig.py`
   - Check database permissions
   - Ensure all required tables exist

2. **Missing Data**

   - Verify course and enrollment data exists
   - Check department name spellings (case-sensitive)
   - Ensure faculty-course relationships are properly set

3. **Chart Display Issues**
   - Verify Chart.js library is loaded
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Ensure data format matches chart expectations

## Support
